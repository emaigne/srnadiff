Description: srnadiff is a package that finds differently expressed regions from
   RNA-seq data at base-resolution level without relying on existing annotation.
   To do so, the package implements the identify-then-annotate methodology that
   builds on the idea of combining two pipelines approachs differential
   expressed regions detection and differential expression quantification.
   It reads BAM files as input, and outputs a list differentially regions,
   together with the adjusted p-values.
