\title{Example constructor}
\usage{
srnadiffExample()
}
\value{
An \code{srnadiffExp} object called '\code{srnaExp}'.
}
\description{
This function provides an example of a \code{srnadiffExp} object which
contains mapped reads of small RNAs extracted from SLK cells infected with
latent KSHV, compared to uninfected SLK cells.
}
\details{
Raw data have been downloaded from the GEO data set GSE62830, provided in
Viollet et \emph{al}. (2015). Adapters were removed with
fastx_clipper and mapped with bowtie2 (Salzberg and Langmead, 2012) on the
human genome version GRCh38.

This example is restricted to a small locus on chr14.
It uses the whole genome annotation (with coding genes, etc.) and extracts
miRNAs.

\examples{
## The 'srnadiffExp' object in this example was constructed by:

\dontrun{

basedir    <- system.file("extdata", package="srnadiff", mustWork = TRUE)
sampleInfo <- read.csv(file.path(basedir, "dataInfo.csv"))
gtfFile    <- file.path(basedir, "Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.76.gtf.gz")
annotReg   <- readAnnotation(gtfFile, feature="gene", source="miRNA")
bamFiles   <- file.path(basedir, sampleInfo$FileName)
srnaExp    <- srnadiffExp(bamFiles, sampleInfo, annotReg)
save(srnaExp, file = file.path(basedir, "srnadiffExample.rda"))
}

srnaExp <- srnadiffExample()
srnaExp
